		&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Hi, I am a multimedia artist and writer based in the Ann Arbor area.

		<br><br>I have been pursuing knowledge in graphic design and communication over the last three years. Ever since I can remember, art has been in my spirit. 

		<br><br>I utilize various media tools in my projects, including Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom Classic, and Canva. I enjoy using my camera to capture beautiful natural views. 

		<br><br>I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in journalism & graphic communication in the fall of 2025. In my major, I gained writing skills and experience with various writing styles and research techniques.

		<br><br>During the summer of 2025, I interned at The Echo newspaper of Eastern Michigan University. I produced more than 20 stories, generated ideas, conducted background research, interviewed, photographed, and
				worked in a news system.
		<br><br>Additionally, I love helping people, and with my graphic communication and writing skills, I strive to incorporate user experience into my designs. 
		<br><br>I took Google’s user experience courses through Volunteer Community College and created prototypes and storyboards for real situations of user experience.
